# Regulated Multiplicity

**Allen Proxmire**  
*Theory of Consciousness and Cognition*

---

## Overview

This repository contains documents developing the **Regulated Multiplicity (RM)** framework: a theoretical account of consciousness, subjectivity, and cognition grounded in the idea that conscious systems are inherently plural and must regulate internal disagreement in order to function.

On the Regulated Multiplicity view, cognition is not the operation of a single unified process, but the regulated interaction of multiple semi-independent internal models (“voices”) that generate questions, propose competing answers, and adjudicate among them over time. Conscious experience is identified with the internal perspective of this regulated adjudication, rather than as an extra ontological property added to information processing.

The repository includes both an extended theoretical manuscript and a short priority note intended to establish authorship and conceptual novelty.

## Core Commitments of the Framework

- Cognitive systems are inherently multiple, not unitary.
- Learning and problem solving require:
  - internal uncertainty,
  - alternative representations,
  - evaluative adjudication,
  - error sensitivity.
- Multiplicity is not pathology; pathology arises from failures of regulation.
- The “self” is a regulatory achievement, not a primitive entity.
- Subjective experience is structurally necessary for cognition, not a mysterious byproduct.
- Consciousness is graded, not binary, and thickens with the richness of internal dialogue.

## Documents in This Repository

### 1. *Regulated Multiplicity and the Structural Necessity of Subjectivity*  
**(Priority Note / Claim Draft)**

A concise, bulleted position document intended to publicly establish priority for the core RM claim, including a distinctive inversion of the traditional “hard problem” of consciousness.

This document explicitly argues that:

- blind processing cannot support cognition,
- subjectivity is the internal standpoint required for adjudication among alternatives,
- the hard problem dissolves once this architectural requirement is made explicit.

### 2. *Regulated Multiplicity, Dialogue, and Consciousness*  
**(Extended Draft Manuscript)**

A longer, prose-driven theoretical manuscript developing the Regulated Multiplicity framework in detail. This document expands the structural argument, engages with psychopathology, development, time perception, and artificial systems, and situates RM relative to existing theories in philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

This manuscript is a working draft and may evolve in future releases.

## Status of the Project

This repository represents ongoing theoretical work. Documents are provided as preprints / drafts to enable open discussion, citation, and further development. No claim is made that the framework is final or complete.

However, the core conceptual claims and architectural commitments of Regulated Multiplicity are fully articulated here.
