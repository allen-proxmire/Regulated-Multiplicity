## Overview
This repository contains drafts, notes, and supporting materials for the **Regulated Multiplicity Hypothesis of Consciousness** — also referred to as the *Stereoscopic Mind*.  

The central idea:  
- Consciousness emerges from the **regulated interaction of multiple semi-independent “voices”** or representational subsystems.  
- Like **binocular vision** generating depth from two perspectives, the mind generates **conscious depth** by integrating multiple internal perspectives.  
- The *degree of consciousness* corresponds to the richness and regulation of this internal dialogue.
